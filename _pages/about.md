Hello there! I'm a Masters Thesis student in the [Department of Aerospace engineering](https://www.aoe.vt.edu/about-us.html) at Virginia Tech. My research interests are mainly focussed on developing computationally optimal guidance-navigation-control architectures, uncertainty quantification and heuristic learning-based decision making algorithms for airborne and space systems. I'm specifically interested in designing sustainable engineering solutions for model-based mission-critical environments, by leveraging my passion towards learning based control theory and stochastic nonlinear dynamics.

Currently I hold the title as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Center for Space Science and Engineering Research Group](https://www.space.vt.edu/) in Virginia Tech, where my role as a lead developer is to design a scalable space network ([SpaceNet](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2023/04/eng-aoe-network-testbed.html)) emulator for mega-constellations and realistic user segments, and deploy for an open-source commercial access.
