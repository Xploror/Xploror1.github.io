        description: "Last month, I had the opportunity to learn about the recent advancements on digital twins (DT) for the Lunar ecosystem at the CisLunar and Lunar Digital Ecosystem Workshop held at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The event was a treasure trove of insights into the current DT platform capabilities and the exciting future prospects for enhanced collaboration within the Cislunar community.From discussions on NASA Digital Twin strategic framework to existing digital transformation platforms like NVIDIA Omniverse, Siemens Xcelerator and emerging platforms such as Sedaro and Cesium Moon Terrain, the list of available softwares and ongoing constant development of high fidelity models and analysis tools is profound! The information received was highly valuable especially for someone who is actively working on a high fidelity lunar satellite constellation testbed to validate feasibility of a sustainable lunar constellation in near future and determine required measures to be taken for a delay/disruption tolerant network (DTN) based lunar satellite communication and navigation. I would love to discuss more on the recent developments and issues in cislunar digital twin efforts which would help me in my future research. If you are someone who has worked or researched on the cislunar dynamics and the current developments and challenges in lunar communication and navigation, please feel free to reach out and be the part of the community!",

Connecting with like-minded individuals and delving into the latest #Astrodynamics research was truly inspiring.During the event, I had the privilege of presenting my research work on &amp;quot;Four Body Invariant Structures And Chaos Analysis For Jovian Multi-Moon Ballistic Transfers,&amp;quot; alongside my advisor Dr. Riley Fitzgerald. I immensely look forward to further discussions on orbital stability and perturbation theory with the community soon. Check out my paper here for more details: https://lnkd.in/dRKJBdpg",
