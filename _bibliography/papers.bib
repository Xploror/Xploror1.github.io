  abstract = { Low Earth Orbit mega-constellations make up a large portion of modern developments in space communications. The ability to simulate and properly research these complex systems is currently being developed to answer questions on the capabilities of the rapidly expanding industry. The development and improvement of a simulation-based platform for satellite network testing can help research efforts to enable industry and government entities to work together in the growing enterprise. The ongoing development of the SpaceNet Testbed is investigated, detailing its use of orbit-based constellation dynamics modeling, software-based emulation, and a hardware-in-the-loop integration design. An overview of the testbed’s software infrastructure design is described alongside details regarding the make-up of its hardware components. Use cases are presented comparing the differences in performance between the satellite network of an actual Starlink mega-constellation currently in orbit and a custom constellation with the same quantity of satellites, but with ideal node spacing and initial orbital positioning. Results of these use cases are then discussed, focusing on the latency of the data traffic and how it differs when varying the testbed's user-defined configurations. In the future, resiliency testing and ground station to satellite link behavior analysis can be included into the testbed. The testbed has potential to help lead efforts in simulating complex space communication systems. }

  abstract = "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining significant popularity due to wide-scale applications in civilian and military use. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are most commonly used for surveillance. Object tracking is one of the most important things that an autonomous UAV has to perform. However, the accuracy of the object tracking model degrades when the object fades away to some distance or if the input images have low resolution. High-resolution cameras are expensive and increase the overall cost of the UAV. The concept of SRGAN-TQT (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network - Temporal Quad-Tree), an improved object tracking pipeline for UAVs in the presence of low-resolution cameras or distant objects, provides a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy to perform object tracking. Implementation of Super-Resolution - Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) and Temporal Quad-Tree (TQT) along with state-of-the-art object detection algorithms serve as the backend of the pipeline. This approach uses Deep Neural Network-based GANs to upsample images precisely. Temporal Quad-Tree (TQT) is a motion tracking technique that is an extension of the popular Quad-Tree segmentation algorithm. The Temporal Quad-Tree algorithm is present to reduce the computational complexity and give a highly reliable tracking algorithm. This consequently omits the requirement of a high-resolution camera for UAVs while increasing the object tracking capability."

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
