         Last month, I had the opportunity to learn about the recent advancements on digital twins (DT) for the Lunar ecosystem at the CisLunar and Lunar Digital Ecosystem Workshop held at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The event was a treasure trove of insights into the current DT platform capabilities and the exciting future prospects for enhanced collaboration within the Cislunar community.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>From discussions on NASA Digital Twin strategic framework to existing digital transformation platforms like NVIDIA Omniverse, Siemens Xcelerator and emerging platforms such as Sedaro and Cesium Moon Terrain, the list of available softwares and ongoing constant development of high fidelity models and analysis tools is profound! The information received was highly valuable especially for someone who is actively working on a high fidelity lunar satellite constellation testbed to validate feasibility of a sustainable lunar constellation in near future and determine required measures to be taken for a delay/disruption tolerant network (DTN) based lunar satellite communication and navigation.</p> <p>I would love to discuss more on the recent developments and issues in cislunar digital twin efforts which would help me in my future research. If you are someone who has worked or researched on the cislunar dynamics and the current developments and challenges in lunar communication and navigation, please feel free to reach out and be the part of the community!

However, shortly after its deployment, it was discovered that the telescope’s primary mirror had a flaw. This flaw caused the images captured by Hubble to be blurry, a significant problem for a mission that cost billions of dollars.</p> <p>At this point, the situation could have easily been derailed by various stakeholders—politicians, bureaucrats, and others—intervening with their own ideas and solutions. However, NASA allowed its experts to take the lead in diagnosing and solving the problem. The scientists and engineers at NASA worked meticulously to develop a corrective optics system, essentially a set of “glasses” for Hubble, to fix the problem.</p> <p>In December 1993, astronauts aboard the space shuttle Endeavour performed a complex and unprecedented servicing mission. They installed the corrective optics and made other necessary upgrades to Hubble. This mission required precise planning, expertise, and execution, and it was successful largely because NASA’s experts were given the autonomy to handle it without external interference.</p> <p>The results were spectacular. Once the corrective optics were in place, Hubble began sending back images of the universe with unprecedented clarity. These images have led to numerous discoveries, including insights into the expansion rate of the universe, the existence of dark energy, and the formation of galaxies.

        NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Voyager 1 spacecraft has re-established data communication with Earth after a five-month silence due to a chip failure in one of its onboard computers. This critical milestone comes after the spacecraft stopped transmitting engineering data in November 2023.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>🛰️ Voyager 1’s Comeback</p> <p>A memory chip in Voyager 1’s flight data subsystem (FDS), which encodes engineering data, failed, stopping data transmission. NASA engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) fixed the issue by changing FDS memory codes, allowing Voyager 1’s health and status data to reach Earth again.</p> <p>🛠️ Troubleshooting in Deep Space</p> <p>On March 15, JPL engineers carried out a comprehensive FDS memory readout to find the problem. Given the spacecraft’s distance—15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers)—replacing the chip was impossible. Instead, engineers devised a method to place the FDS memory codes in separate memory locations. This novel approach worked, and on April 20, the first data from Voyager 1 in months was received, confirming the spacecraft’s health.</p> <p>🎉 Celebration at NASA’s JPL</p> <p>The return of Voyager 1’s data after five months was celebrated at NASA’s JPL, marking a crucial moment in the spacecraft’s journey and showcasing the ingenuity of the engineering team.</p> <p>🌌 Pushing the Boundaries of Space</p> <p>Voyager 1, launched over 35 years ago, is the first human-made object to enter interstellar space. This re-established communication opens a new page in Voyager 1’s space odyssey, demonstrating the resilience and importance of the mission in exploring the unknown boundaries of the universe.</p> <p>What do you think about Voyager 1’s return to communication?

        VOYAGER PHONE HOME | Welcome to part five of our ongoing series on Voyager drama this year. Why write about it? Because Voyager is awesome—it is a triumph of the human species—and NASA engineers continue to pull off remarkable feats—plus news nowadays sucks.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In this latest installment of the saga, Voyager activated a backup radio transmitter that hasn’t been used since 1981!</p> <p>Let that sink in…</p> <p>A few weeks ago, our interstellar friend experienced a temporary communication blackout. A command from NASA’s Deep Space Network—a global array of giant radio antennas—prompted it to turn on a heater, but Voyager didn’t respond. Instead, it autonomously powered down its primary X-band transmitter and switched to the secondary S-band transmitter, which uses less power. This was Voyager’s way of going into a protective mode to conserve its finite energy.</p> <p>Here’s the problem: engineers must troubleshoot this issue from over 15 billion miles away. Every command takes about 23 hours to reach Voyager, and another 23 hours for its response to return.</p> <p>Realizing the S-band transmitter had activated was a genuine surprise—after 43 years, the signal from this transmitter was so faint that NASA wasn’t even sure they’d be able to detect it. But thankfully, they reconnected, and now begins the hard work of figuring out what happened with that heater.</p> <p>Launched way back in 1977, Voyager finally crossed into interstellar space in 2012, escaping the boundary of our solar system. Though it’s an unimaginable distance, in cosmic terms, it’s just the beginning. Voyager hasn’t even traveled a full light-day—the distance light covers in 24 hours.</p> <p>To put that into perspective, it’s journeyed only about .002 light-years. One light year spans about 6 trillion miles. And with our closest star, Proxima Centauri, sitting 4.25 light-years away, Voyager still has a staggering 40,000 years to go before it reaches another star system.</p> <p>Simply unfathomable—and humbling. P.S. Space may seem vast and empty, but it’s anything but. It brims with gas, dust, light, radiation, and countless other hazards. Voyager’s resilience is astounding, and every innovative fix that keeps it alive is a marvel worth sharing.</p> <p>In the end, Voyager is cold and lonely. One day, sooner than we’d like, we’ll lose this precious connection. And when that day comes, it’ll be a “Titanic tears” moment, at least for me. So, take a second to appreciate the audacious journey—and that we’re lucky enough to witness it.</p> <p>P.P.S. If humanity can fix a probe billions of miles away, surely we can tackle the technological challenges a little closer to home (nudge nudge, wink wink).</p> <p>Keep on beepin’ on, little buddy.</p> <p>#technology #innovation #space #nasa To view or add a comment, sign in</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>            515 followers

However, during certain solar storms, a void of low solar wind pressure/density is created around planet, in response to which, the higher ionospheric pressure expand the plasma region to greater heights to establish an equilibrium. This pressure competition leads to an elevated density at greater heights (500-4000 km altitude above planet surface) which can create a drag to satellites orbiting around planets. This causes de-orbit or bursting of satellites or damage its electronics. Therefore, these first results enhance our understanding about the planetary space weather during quietest solar wind conditions. This research sheds light on dynamics of our solar system bodies and offers new insights into the Sun-Planet or Steller Wind-Exo-Planets interactions.

        During spaceflight, the central nervous system (CNS) is exposed to a complex array of environmental stressors. However, the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the CNS and the resulting impact to crew health and operational performance remain largely unknown. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding spaceflight-associated changes to the brain as measured by magnetic resonance imaging, particularly as they relate to mission duration. Numerous studies have reported macrostructural changes to the brain after spaceflight, including alterations in brain position, tissue volumes and cerebrospinal fluid distribution and dynamics. Changes in brain tissue microstructure and connectivity were also described, involving regions related to vestibular, cerebellar, visual, motor, somatosensory and cognitive function.

It has since then reinforced mankind’s understanding of the microscopic world and unlocked a new perspective of reality itself. Although its emergence was molded in response to the understanding of unexplained phenomena observed in early particle experiments, the theory itself speaks about how bizarrely unintuitive the reality of any physical system is, when viewed with respect to the quantum states involved. To mathematically assert the framework of Quantum Mechanics (QM), Schrodinger’s wave function denoted by 𝜓 (psi) was formulated which is undoubtedly to date the best mathematical tool to give insights on the quantum states of a particle with a probabilistic approach. The wave function indeed has been rigorously tested along with the experiments and continuous hypothesis testing for decades where it is not only compliant with experimental results but interestingly, the behavior of 𝜓 prior and post-measurement had given birth to a plethora of open-ended interpretations on the nature of objective reality. Perhaps the biggest hurdle in Quantum Mechanics is the so-called measurement problem which questions the inevitable collapse of the wave function to determinism whenever an observation is made. Consequently, a measurement process is such a huge deal that it not only is the additional assumption Quantum Mechanics needs to reproduce results for, but in fact, it’s also completely incompatible with the Schrodinger equation itself. This is because the 𝜓 for a physical quantum system statistically represents its quantum states until a measurement process occurs, after which the 𝜓 distribution apparently collapses/changes to a certain fixed possibility with a 100% probability. Such discontinuity in Schrodinger’s equation and an unexplainable role of measurement in such experiments had baffled the scientific community from the very beginning which led to a century-long brainstorming on various interpretations of what the quantum states described by the 𝜓 exactly speak about the relevant physical system.</p> <blockquote>“<em>When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.</em>” — Max Planck</blockquote> <figure><img alt="Wheeler’s delayed choice experiment" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/469/0*Xh95PowzFAdWyW_C.gif"/><figcaption>Wheeler’s delayed choice experiment (<a href="https://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kcy05t/dcqe.html">photo credit</a>)</figcaption></figure> <p>Imagine a setup where we are observing a physical quantum system similar to Wheeler’s delayed choice experiment. The setup would involve a quantum system (obviously!), bunch of possible physical states and particle detectors. So lets imagine the scenario, we initiate our quantum system, let it propagate through the experiment and finally we check for the results. If we as observers choose not to use the detectors, the final results would look like a superposition of all the possible states the quantum system could possibly have, whereas interestingly if we do somehow choose to place detectors (allowing us to read the localized quantum system) after the quantum system has already entered the possible paths but just before measurement, somehow the quantum system’s 𝜓 distribution would collapse into one definite state sanely suggesting that the quantum system, just on the act of measurement transitioned from taking all the paths simultaneously to deciding on one definite path affecting a decision in past! If our current laws of physics is consistent (which probably is), then the above result infers that the observer’s choice of measurement determines how a quantum system evolved in past, independent of when the choice was taken. This suggests strongly that the 𝜓 distribution of the system is highly correlated to the preparation of the setup and the observer’s perspective at any point of time which defeats the absoluteness of any observed event. This would probably make you think, what does the quantum state of a physical quantum system like above, would tell us about the nature of reality? Does the states represented by 𝜓, provides with the factual data about the world or it just represents the state of the observer’s knowledge about the world?</p> <p>In search for an answer to above questions, multiple interpretations of Quantum Mechanics have been diligently classified into two philosophical classifications by Harrigan and Spekkens (2010) : <strong>𝜓 — Ontic</strong> and <strong>𝜓 — Epistemic models</strong>.</p> <figure><img alt="Comparison of quantum states in 𝜓-Ontic &amp; 𝜓-Epistemic model, showing the dependance on two different Ontic (Reality based) states with corresponding 𝜓₁ &amp; 𝜓₂.

In 𝜓-Ontic model, the quantum state and ontic states are unique while in 𝜓-Epistemic model, more than one 𝜓 can represent a quantum state (<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/quantum-word-real-world-thing/">Credit</a>)</figcaption></figure> <p>Even though ontological theories like Everrett’s Many-World, Bohmian mechanics, GRW model etc gives an insight on how can we interpret the reality given by the wave function, originally one can also think that there might be some deterministic variables unknown to the current Quantum Theory which would indirectly insinuate about the underlying behaviour of the system. It would then suggest that the measurements doesn’t provide with any factual data about the reality but just the state of the observer’s limited knowledge about it. Such a perspective on QM is called 𝜓 — Epistemic, an interpretation which is highly motivated by the fact that the underlying reality doesn’t depend on the variable settings of environment and that the arising probabilities is purely due to the lack of complete knowledge about the system. Scientists like Einstein and Bohr were the initial pillars to this theory, who believed on the determinacy of the true nature of reality and that the measurement inconsistencies arises due to human minds just not apt enough to comprehend these hidden variables.</p> <p>However if that’s the case, its interesting to note the behaviour of quantum systems while setting some baseline expectations similar to that of a classical system in order to show determinacy. This is exactly what John Bell did when he stated the assumptions for his infamous Bell’s theorem where he assumed some properties: Locality, Realism and Statistical Independence. In simple words, Locality states that causes and effects can’t move faster than speed of light; the Realism means that there are always some definite properties of a system which are inherent in nature irrespective of any sort of measurement, whereas the statistical independence suggests that the result of an experiment is uncorrelated to the detector/measurement settings. With such assumptions taken into account, he theoretically showed that quantum mechanics is absolutely incompatible with any classical theory (abiding local realism), which indirectly suggest that the quantum world is not locally real. Infact this statement was so huge for the fact that it straightaway disagrees with Einstein’s EPR Paradox, that experiments were conceptualized to test it out, all packing into the category of now known as bell tests. One of these test is to check for the CHSH inequality which could possibly revert the status of QM back to local realism however, all the relevant modern experiments had been consistently violated it so far. A brief description about the same can be found <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/bells-theorem/">here</a>.</p> <figure><img alt="Visualization of entanglement, a nonlocal phenomena which challenges the EPR Paradox" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wQ9vMcW4XpTG1FjR.jpg"/><figcaption>Visualization of entanglement, a nonlocal phenomena which challenges the EPR Paradox (<a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/free-videos/quantum-entanglement">Photo credit</a>)</figcaption></figure> <p>Even though within such a chaotic stance, there are frequent new definition of theories catering to explanations on how an epistemical theory can agree with local causality but still violates the Bell’s inequalities when experimented. One such significant theory is Superdeterminism. Now this theory claims some very bold properties about Quantum Mechanics, but for starters it is kind of a hidden variable theory which is consistent with the experimental results and conspicuously shows the local correlation between the measurement settings and the quantum states of the system. This can be thought intuitively when we remember that modern experiments have proven that for any hidden variable concepts, the bell’s inequality is always violated, hence looking back to the assumption that bases his theorem, a local hidden variable theory such as superdeterminism could violate the inequality only if it violates statistical independence. Lets think about what it leads to, if a theory which is locally real shows a certain dependance of behaviour of quantum particles on the measurement settings, then there has to be some way to explain such dependance for certain experiments where instantaneous 𝜓 collapse leads to non-locality (simple example of entanglement). To think of it there are actually two ways around, first way is to just admit that the quantum particles are the way they depict themselves, completely unpredictable and hence indeed believe that the states truly are not determined at any stage of the experiment until its measured and somehow the collapse can send information faster than the speed of light. Certainly this is exactly what the traditional Copenhagen interpretation is based on. But on the second hand, if locality is to be conserved, there has to be an introduction to absolute determinism in the universe, which speaks that not only all the objects, events evolving in time are predetermined but infact the thought of having a choice in an experiment itself is also fixed. This claim certainly is one kind of a living nightmare and naturally it begs the question whether free will of any sort exists or not? Its initially confusing but this question does have an out of the box answer to it, quite literally. If our universe is a block universe such that every event pertaining to certain space-time location within itself could be absolutely determined by some higher dimensional being outside the influence of spacetime, who can perceive both space and time as a single block, then for them determining everything in past, present and future about our cosmos is as intuitive as pre-deciding the whole journey in their minds. This could be theoretically possible since its known that universe is a 4 dimensional space-time manifold which means everything inside, experiences the flow of time, but that doesn’t mean that the universe itself is moving in time, rather it just contains a time dimension within it. Hence universe being a time-invariant block advocates the concept of superdeterminism even though physicists, humans in general living inside the universe and experiencing flow of time, can have free will to choose possibilities in future.</p> <p>Its totally understandable if concepts like SuperDeterminism weirdly sounds like claiming some superpositioned jargon about the nature of anything in this universe, but what if the universe completely depends on what the observer has the knowledge about it. A theory which imagines a state not to be any property describing about the system but its the observer’s state about the system, hence the probabilities involved are just a reflection to an observer’s beliefs but most importantly this abandons the objective nature of reality, for which the Quantum Mechanics was built in the first place. This theory is not called super-probabilistic but rather its called Quantum Bayesianism or QBism which is a recent development of early 21st Century. As the name insinuates, probability has a big role in it, where whenever a measurement is taken, its considered not as probabilities collapsing but actually the observer updating their belief about the system, just like how Bayesian probability works. With such a simple perspective, the wavefunction collapse sounds perfectly fine because now the measurement just speaks about an information depending on the observer and doesn’t even affect the system anyhow, hence problems like non-locality and non-causality doesn’t arise with the collapse. Its pretty evident how it quickly solves all the puzzles we have been talking about, but if noticed carefully it doesn’t talk anything about an objective reality in-fact it blatantly advocates the subjective nature of a system. Observers are the center piece to this interpretation where actually 𝜓 doesn’t talk about the system but it has been all about the observers. Each observer’s baseline reality is different and hence the measured 𝜓 for the universe would individually update their own beliefs coherently independent of other observer’s update. QBism is pretty much supported by many minds because of how it solves the measurement problem but, fairly judging it, even though its an epistemical idea, it just completely ignores an underlying reality independent of anything in the universe which is the core belief of all the other models within the subclass.</p> <figure><img alt="Christopher Fuchs, the pioneering physicist who developed the modern concept of Quantum Bayesianism (QBism)" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*HGwY1vq7_uRwozFO.jpg"/><figcaption>Christopher Fuchs, the pioneering physicist who developed the modern concept of Quantum Bayesianism (QBism)</figcaption></figure> <p>𝜓 — Epistemic models have certainly been in a chaotic regime from the time it was first coined, but even though these models have emerged in order to reason the age old inevitable inconsistencies in the wave function, efforts on new perspectives to QM and sufficing the experimental datas with constantly updating physics had just led to a deeper understanding about our own knowledge about the universe. However, there are other group of experts whose interpretation is rather more practical where the physical reality explained by the wave function is literally considered as the true nature of the universe. The emergence of such theories have been, in past few decades, supported by various experiments and paperwork, which has turned the winds towards the <a href="https://medium.com/@suryaryan/wavefunction-the-realm-of-realism-9d4e21702565">Ontological models</a>.</p> <h3>References</h3> <ul><li><a href="http://www.bottomlayer.com/bottom/basic_delayed_choice.htm">Wheeler&#39;s Delayed Choice Experiment&quot;</a></li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06462">Rethinking Superdeterminism</a></li><li><a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/bells-theorem/">Bell&#39;s Theorem | Brilliant Math &amp; Science Wiki</a></li><li><a href="https://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/scs_articles/517/?utm_source=digitalcommons.chapman.edu%2Fscs_articles%2F517&amp;utm_medium=PDF&amp;utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages">Is the Quantum State Real?

Even though physicists throughout the years have constructed a concrete quantum framework on which theoretical and experimental data agree exceptionally, the core of this framework is probably the most arcane aspect of all. The <strong>wave function 𝜓</strong>,<strong> </strong>is probably the most controversial “object” in the world of metaphysics which is extensively exploited in the field of Quantum Mechanics (QM) and yet we have no idea what it truly represents. You might be familiar with the famous Schrodinger equation which basically speaks about the dynamics of a particle given its Hamiltonian and the solution to this equation is a unique wave function 𝜓. Even though the Born rule is applied to statistically analyze possible states of a particle when a measurement is to be taken, it is still very unintuitive to actually visualize what the 𝜓 truly plays as in the relevant mathematics involved. Above all the strangeness in Quantum Mechanics, the Schrodinger equation seems to very accurately predict the motion of a particle in a probabilistic manner but its use case seems to be limited the moment any measurement occurs on the relevant quantum system. This phenomenon is widely known as the wavefunction collapse and the scientific community has barely any conclusive lead on what could be the reason for such bizarre behavior of a particle or the so-called wavefunction associated. The early scientific community realized the intensity of this problem and subsequently today there exist a lot of philosophical interpretations of QM which have existed for almost the same time as the theory itself, around a century ago. It all started with a question of what the wave function of a particle means in reality. Is it a physical wave in some unperceivable higher-dimensional space or is it just a tool to get a piece of statistical information about the quantum states of the system being observed?</p> <blockquote>“<em>As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.</em>”</blockquote> <blockquote>— Albert Einstein</blockquote> <h4>Ontological nature of QM</h4> <p>When the solution for wavefunction collapse is given a thought, then it has to fit all the experimental results, and since we are aware of the existence of experiments like a double slit and delayed choice experiment, its trivial to imagine that a certain experiment on a quantum system would result in quantum states that are highly correlated to the experimental setup itself. In other words, every quantum experiment has a clear distinction between a measuring instrument/observer (macroscopic entity) and the quantum system being measured, where additionally, the quantum states are a superposition of experimental outcomes which are interestingly influenced by the experimental setup or the physical state of the observer, therefore it strongly implies that the Schrodinger equation suggests that the observer itself is in some kind of superposition of distinct states involved, which is conspicuously not true because if it were, we would have vivid visuals of the world without being drunk! In the well-accepted Copenhagen interpretation the solution for this is the Born rule which is a statistical view of observers’ superposition but again, according to the rule 𝜓 evolves deterministically as per Schrodinger equation but breaks down during a measurement event, which shows the inconsistency of Copenhagen interpretation.</p> <p>The involvement of the experimental setups and the detector settings in manipulating the dynamics of the states of a quantum system is the branch called Operational Quantum Mechanics. With such a perspective, it is imperative to distinguish between the experimented quantum system and the experimental apparatus, a macroscopic entity. However very quickly one realizes that there are some core philosophical questions to be dealt with. What and when is there a solid partition between a quantum system and an observer so that one can classify components of an experiment to their respective roles? What is the role of consciousness during measurement and does the quantum system experience an observer’s presence?</p> <p>Such partition between classical and quantum systems is known as <em>Heisenberg’s cut</em> and is only valid for interpretations where the collapse postulate holds like Copenhagen’s interpretation. Nevertheless, one thing is clear, in order for 𝜓 to represent some property of a quantum system abiding with some objective reality, it should involve experimental setup or the physical system acting as an input to the equation and somehow the resulting property should be invariant to any observer or consciousness within the universe. Note that this kind of thought process in the first place considers that 𝜓 describes something about the physical reality or at least insinuates some property of the physical system which is different from an epistemical approach on QM where it’s the observer and their knowledge about the system in question. There are few significant ontological models on QM that tries to cleverly eliminate the measurement collapse diligently avoiding non-causality and non-locality problems pointed out in the PBR theorem, as well as intuitively suggesting how the physical reality responds.</p> <figure><img alt="Ontological perspective of wavefunction spreading all over the universe" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/647/1*drOZpakuDB30SFoI7lPwjg.png"/><figcaption>Ontological perspective of wavefunction spreading all over the universe (photo: shutterstock)</figcaption></figure> <h4>Many Worlds Interpretation</h4> <p>Many world theory is a concept derived from the Everrettian interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, first-ever appearing in the physicist Hugh Everett III’s thesis work. It is by far the most famous multi-universal concept replicated colossally in many sci-fi movies, TV shows, and even in a few fictional books. The basis for this interpretation lies in the idea that each state corresponding to a determined outcome for a quantum system in some experiment has relative states of other objects involved in this experimental system which either directly or indirectly interact with the quantum system. As a simple example, if we consider the system involves a quantum system, an apparatus that reads the outcome (an action of direct interaction) and an observer that refers to the environment that records these outcomes (an action of indirect interaction), then for a particular quantum state corresponding to a deterministic outcome, there is a relative superposition of states of environment capturing the result and relative states of observers observing the result from the environment. Moreover, there is no reason for an “objective” mechanism to exist that is biased to one fixed outcome when a measurement happens and so it is considered that all the combination of states of distinct entities involved, truly happens and could be only observed by an entity living outside the influence of quantum effects we experience in this universe (God’s-eye-view). If that’s the case, the collapsing nature of 𝜓 distribution is completely eliminated, since all the outcomes exist in its own different world. It is to be noted that this is an ontological model in the sense that 𝜓 distribution is treated as something that exists in reality and is equally present for as many worlds as the theory itself creates. And so even though an observer in its universe might not feel its superposition counterparts in another universe because theoretically with current cosmological models, an entity in one universe can’t sense or interact with other universe apart from their parent universe at all, it makes sense that an experiment done and followed in one universe would be perceived as a 𝜓 collapse giving one deterministic outcome because the true 𝜓 existing in some n-dimensional manifold was observed by someone in a 3-D universe and so where there can be a continuum of outcomes possible, the observer observes the projected 𝜓 in the observed 3-D universe as a determined outcome. But interestingly there is a cascading effect where a choice of observation or a unique interaction with a superposed quantum system in a universe will branch into infinitely many other possible worlds irrespective of whether the outcomes were discrete or continuous because the quantum state is not the only thing in superposition but the macroscopic entities, the observer and indeed the world itself is coherently in superposition.</p> <p>When the quest for understanding Quantum Mechanics leads to plausible ontological theory on Infinite Universes, its acceptance solely depends on whether concepts like infinities and isolated macroscopic superposition worlds are rational with respect to the absolute reality, to which no possible experiment is yet capable of proving or disproving it. However, some critics have indeed pointed out a few minute flaws in the theory for example, What mechanism is responsible for the splitting of these worlds? If an object or a person does have copies of their own in other worlds, then what defines them as a “copy”? If each self has its own consciousness, being apt enough to make different choices, then how is a “true self” defined? These questions need to be addressed with revised philosophical definitions at a fundamental level and hence within the scientific community, there are a plethora of perspectives to it just based on its relative nature.</p> <blockquote>“When a physicist measures the spin of an electron, say in the north direction, the wave function of the electron and the measuring apparatus and the physicist are supposed, in the realist approach, to evolve deterministically, as dictated by the Schrödinger equation; but in consequence of their interaction during the measurement, the wave function becomes a superposition of two terms, in one of which the electron spin is positive and everyone in the world who looks into it thinks it is positive, and in the other the spin is negative and everyone thinks it is negative. Since in each term of the wave function everyone shares a belief that the spin has one definite sign, the existence of the superposition is undetectable. In effect the history of the world has split into two streams, uncorrelated with each other. … This is strange enough, but the fission of history would not only occur when someone measures a spin. In the realist approach the history of the world is endlessly splitting; it does so every time a macroscopic body becomes tied in with a choice of quantum states.”</blockquote> <blockquote>— Steven Weinberg (<em>The New York Review of Books</em>)</blockquote> <figure><img alt="A visualization of infinite unique Earths suggested by Everrett Interpretation" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*su8iANzV3UiYxRb3.jpg"/><figcaption>A visualization of infinite unique Earths suggested by Everrett Interpretation (Photo: Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure> <h4>GRW — Spontaneous Collapse Theory</h4> <p>Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory is a relatively recent collapse model which is based on a few explicit assumptions one of which suggests that the Schrodinger equation is incorrect. Rather it proposes a stochastic nonlinear dynamical mechanism that similar to the Schrodinger equation, describes the evolution of the wave function but additionally the act of state collapse or so-called “hit” is governed by the stochastic nature of evolution where the resulting localization is not measurement-induced but instead it is probabilistically evolving. With these assumptions, the progenitors of the theory not only address an alternative explanation for a spontaneous collapse but it provide a single dynamical equation that takes into account the quantum properties of fundamental particles, the classical properties of the macroscopic world, and the bridge connecting both regimes. The explanation for these probabilistic (random) collapses of the constituents of any physical system is explained through the <em>collapse rate, </em>i.e. number of collapses per unit time. Mathematically the act of measurement is represented as a localization operator operating on the wave function of the system and because the Gaussian functions are involved in the operator, intuitively a radius of the selected metric is established which acts as a boundary between a significant localization (macroscopic property) and an ineffective localization (microscopic property). As a standard, the metric is taken as the position and therefore the threshold radius is the length scale after which collapse rates are significantly high. In simpler terms, if the superposition of position states of a system is greater than this threshold radius, then the Gaussian part of the operator suppresses all the possible states except the closest one to the center of collapse, in short, localizes to a deterministic state, whereas if the superposition is within the threshold radius, none of the states are suppressed which is a direct consequence to a lesser collapse rate. According to GRW, the probability of an electron or proton to experience a collapse on average is around 10⁸ years, and hence practically one would never see a violation of Heisenberg’s uncertainty for these fundamental particles. Moreover, when such particles bunch together to form a relatively macroscopic object, the sheer number of particles outweighs the minute collapse rate value for individual particles, for example, if a particle collapses every 10¹⁸ seconds and the macroscopic object has around 10²⁶ such particles, then probabilistically, on average there would be 10⁸ collapses every second, which is sufficiently enough to perceive as a well-localized wave function in space. The concept indeed sounds reasonable and brings out a logical perspective of the transition from uncertain quantum properties to deterministic classical properties, however, GRW-like collapse theories carry some ontological problems. <em>Tails problem</em> is one of the well-known problems to such a theory which points out the spreading nature of wavefunction to infinity in all dimensions due to the Schrodinger dynamics and if that’s what happens then even though for a sufficiently macroscopic entity, the wavefunction would still have a non-zero value extending to infinity, just like a tail stretching to infinity. to infinity. This leads to a reasonable question of how can we interpret these tails if their existence insinuates that nothing, not even a huge macroscopic entity is truly localized in space. This part of the problem is called a <em>bare-tails problem</em> or <em>counting anomaly</em> on which to this date still open research is conducted, however, a considerable explanation given by the proponents of the theory explains that the mod-square of the wave function at a location provides mass density and therefore the wavefunction distribution extending to infinity for macroscopic entities indicates the immeasurable amount of sparse matter. Moreover, this is one of the resulting interpretations of the Mass Density approach to GRW, that has been mentioned in a vast number of relevant paperworks. However, the bare-tail problem extends to an even greater interpretational problem called the <em>structured tails problem, </em>where in the realist perspective, if the center of the distribution collapse structure determines a state configuration then the tail of the distribution should also be determining a similar configuration and because GRW clearly specifies that the center collapse structure determines the macroscopic localization, therefore the sparse structured matter due to the tail exists in a way non-interactive to our world, highly encouraging the Everrettian worlds idea. To understand this, consider the moment the box is revealed and we find the Schrodinger’s cat is alive, the wave function for the system collapsed into the “alive” physical state, but due to the inevitable presence of a non-zero tail of the wavefunction, there would always exist a negligible amount of sparse matter structured towards the “dead” state of the system but existing and interacting in a different world. There has been a constant update on the GRW postulates ever since and an innumerable amount of paperwork by the proponents as well as the critics therefore even though there is no conclusive settlement on GRW, there are a lot of open perspectives from various metaphysics groups with contrasting opinions on the same.</p> <figure><img alt="A standard QM von Neumann collapse leaving negligible traces of tails of hte wavefunction causing the tails problem" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/618/0*DXBcHHhPRBkzijyB.png"/><figcaption>A standard QM von Neumann collapse leaving negligible traces of tails of hte wavefunction causing the tails problem (<a href="https://romanfrigg.org/wp-content/uploads/writings/GRW%20Theory.pdf">Roman Frigg ‘GRW Theory’ 2009</a>)</figcaption></figure> <h4>Bohmian Mechanics/Pilot Wave Theory</h4> <p>Bohmian Mechanics or the Pilot Wave Theory is probably by far the most intuitive ontological theory of all with quite interesting claims. It’s a quasi-deterministic theory that explains most of the quantum phenomena without ever encountering the measurement problem. The theory claims that all the particles are indeed particle-like forever, moreover, there exists a real wave that determines their bizarre trajectory. The structure of this wave is according to the Schrodinger equation where additionally, there is another equation that governs the motion of the particle within the wave which is called the guiding equation. The guiding equation is the only extra mathematics that the theory requires apart from the existing equations in Quantum mechanics but since it’s derived from the Schrodinger equation itself, it’s considered that this equation existed all along. The interesting side of Bohmian mechanics is that it speaks about special trajectories that particles take because of the waves on which they <em>surf</em>, these unique trajectories (non-crossing rule) are famously called Bohm trajectories and it is exacty the same as a classical chaotic trajectory. Given an initial state of the particle like its position and the velocity, there is a unique trajectory the particle will traverse as per the evolution of the real wave. This means that the particle’s path is actually deterministic in nature where the observed superposition of paths is due to the small perturbations in the initial states of the particles in the collection which leads to large uncorrelated deviations as it traverses through the wave. The theory is reasonable in context to the wave nature that arises just because of the existence of various states a particle can undergo in an experiment. Moreover, the fact that it’s because of the lack of precision readings that it’s impossible to measure the exact state of a particle to figure out its entire trajectory beforehand is what makes Bohmian mechanics very analogous to a classical chaos theory. However, even after eliminating the measurement problem by introducing determinism in the dynamics of the particles, this theory is considered to be a no-go theorem because of the few conflicts and emerging nonlocalities. Unlike other interpretations of QM which are invariant to relativistic effects, Bohmian Mechanics which is based on the absolute time concept is rather incompatible with General Relativity itself because the physical spacetime with an absolute frame from the beginning of time doesn’t fit with the relativity ideologies. Apart from that, the theory also conflicts with the PBR theorem. Indeed the dynamics of the particle is described by the wave but the theory also states that the structure of the wave is itself described by the particles. And since the wavefunction is considered to be a physical wave and globally spread throughout the universe, this suggests that a particle’s state can be affected by any other particle in the universe quite instantaneously which breaks the concept of locality. However, proponents of the theory have used this argument to support the inevitable emergence of entanglement which we can observe in reality and could be derived from the nonlocal potential of Bohmian Mechanics. Moreover, a theory like Bohmian Mechanics which considers the physical existence of the pilot wave in some higher dimension with its corresponding variables non-existent in the standard Hilbert space, is a form of <em>hidden variable</em> theory that suggests why such a simple concept almost analogous to a classical theory can generate nonlocalities.</p> <blockquote>“If a hidden variable theory is local it will not agree with quantum mechanics, and if it agrees with quantum mechanics it will be non-local”</blockquote> <blockquote>-John S. Bell</blockquote> <figure><img alt="Pilot wave theory visualization of bohm trajectories guided by the real wave on a double-slit experiment" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7EQZHwlaWzec_9I2.png"/><figcaption>Pilot wave theory visualization of bohm trajectories guided by the real wave on a double-slit experiment (Photo: Pinterest)</figcaption></figure> <h3>References</h3> <ul><li><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-issues/">Philosophical Issues in Quantum Theory</a></li><li><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2021.770764/full">Ontology of a Wavefunction from the Perspective of an Invariant Proper Time</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10138035/">Collapse Models: A Theoretical, Experimental and Philosophical Review</a></li><li><a href="https://settheory.net/Bohm">Problems with Bohmian mechanics</a></li></ul> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9d4e21702565" width="1" height="1" alt=""/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">A new phase of matter — Time Crystals, from Impossible to Reality</title><link href="https://xploror.github.io/blog/2022/a-new-phase-of-mattertime-crystals-from-impossible-to-reality/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A new phase of matter — Time Crystals, from Impossible to Reality"/><published>2022-06-23T16:00:16+00:00</published><updated>2022-06-23T16:00:16+00:00</updated><id>https://xploror.github.io/blog/2022/a-new-phase-of-mattertime-crystals-from-impossible-to-reality</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://xploror.github.io/blog/2022/a-new-phase-of-mattertime-crystals-from-impossible-to-reality/"><![CDATA[<h3>A new phase of matter — Time Crystals, from Impossible to Reality</h3> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/1*FRg3ONmsxVw3MC9UCHE0ZA.png"/></figure> <p>A recent discovery made by the team of researchers using Google’s Quantum computer has introduced a potential candidate for a new phase of matter only been heard in stories and movies before. The first ever discrete Quantum Time Crystal stabilized as a result of many-body localization (MBL) process was created and observed inside the quantum computer, Sycamore, last November 2021 and it behaved exactly as originally theorized back in 2012, by Nobel laureate <em>Frank Wilczek.</em></p> <p>Analogous to an ordinary crystal lattice, which has a certain arrangement of atoms in repeating pattern with respect to space, in order to attain the lowest energy state possible , a theoretical time crystal naturally repeats and flips between its states periodically with time without consuming any form of energy, as a natural characteristic of repeating pattern but in time instead of space. Indeed, the time crystal created inside Sycamore did show this unique property where it flipped from one state to another with regular time interval without any input source. The team used 20 superconductive qubit system where each qubit was randomly pointing to one of its states ( here states represent the quantum spins ), with all of them placed close enough to interact with each other. This arrangement acts as a time crystal when a driving external stimulus like laser was passed through it. Interestingly, though laser was used as an external stimulus, the system didn’t consume any kind of energy at all, and strangely the behavior of time crystal was unexpected when the frequency of flipping between states was different than the frequency of laser beam being used, indicating this intrinsic property of time crystals.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/337/1*J8WBMOTKQmUk9IgR41BElQ.jpeg"/><figcaption>Google’s Quantum Computer <strong>Sycamore</strong></figcaption></figure> <p>Though time crystals were first theorized in 2012, it was first identified and confirmed in 2016 during an experiment on 14 trapped Ytterbium ions out of their mutual coulomb attraction, where an alternating sequence of laser pulses were used to drive the flipping of their spins. The observations made were crystal clear indicating the oscillatory time evolution of spin which was exactly twice the period of laser been used. In fact, these spin oscillations persisted even when changing the parameters of the laser. This was the first experimental evidence of a spontaneous violation to long known time-translational symmetry which was thought to be obeyed by all the matter. Time translational symmetry states simply that irrespective of time, the laws of physics would be same at any instance of time anywhere in space. Conservation laws like conservation of energy, are the direct consequences of time symmetry. And therefore, there were a lot of past debate on considering time crystals violating some of the fundamental laws, which should make it impossible to even exist. Does switching states without consuming energy indefinitely, makes it a perpetual motion system? or does it violate the conservation of energy?</p> <p>A time crystal is <strong>not a</strong> <strong>perpetual motion system</strong>. To think of it, it is a quantum system which is stimulated by an energy source but doesn’t consume nor produce energy or work of any sort, because a time crystal is already in its lowest energy state possible. Also, unlike perpetual motion systems, time crystals in a finite amount of time would never reach in equilibrium, because to break time symmetry, it should be a non-equilibrium matter (switching between dynamic states though it might jump past its stable and unstable equilibrium states ).</p> <p>While it has a natural behavior of continuously flipping from one state to another, it doesn’t really contribute to the term entropy, its overall energy is contained indefinitely by existing in dynamic states where laws of thermodynamics don’t fit well. In other words, thermodynamic laws explain a long-term process but not the shorter constituent instances of it. And so, the overall time crystal process results into net zero entropy, <strong>not violating the laws of thermodynamics</strong> but still acts as if it breaks it.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WSMYcKetB5N1nbeL-tQb1A.png"/><figcaption>Visualization of time evolution of Time crystals (flipping states)</figcaption></figure> <p>If we think from a quantum approach, experimental time crystals ever made, constitutes of only few countable number of atoms, ions, or qubits, so if we observe any property of this system then quantum effects will definitely play a crucial role in it. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many_body_localization">many-body localization</a> system and a macroscopic object is very different in context to behavior it exhibits to a local observer. Time crystal is a many-body localization system which mean that it is made of few number of particles each of them interacting with each other and overall truly isolated from the external environment. Because of this isolated system made of only few particles, the overall energy of this system will greatly depend on any of the particle’s relative motions about rest of them, changing in terms of electromagnetic interaction energy as well as its kinetic energy. This restricts the arrangement and states of MBL systems a lot because of conservation of energy. More to it when governing quantum equations like Schrodinger equation doesn’t allow any quantum particle to be stationary in any sense with respect to time, MBL’s states naturally evolves while respecting conservation of energy, thus according to quantum statistical mechanics, evolves towards the thermal equilibrium. But it never reaches thermal equilibrium for finite time, violating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenstate_thermalization_hypothesis">eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</a> and instead, its dynamic states are close to its initial condition or initial arrangement of states. And that’s why, this makes time crystals to be in stable non-equilibrium states which are also called as Floquet states. The moment, they can interact with external environment, energy can be exchanged and now there can be much greater number of possible configurations for the particles in the system, thus reaching thermal equilibrium and losing its temporal property.</p> <p>Imagine a simple pendulum in gravitational influence, where the bob oscillates back and forth about its stable equilibrium state with respect to time, if this pendulum is continuously fed by some driving oscillation, then the bob will always avoid being in its stable ground state equilibrium and would be able to reach other non-equilibrium states even as a perfect inverted bob (stable non-equilibrium state) if, of course, driving oscillation is sufficient. But the moment this driving force is gone, effects like hinge friction, loses energy to its surroundings which makes it ultimately reach its stable equilibrium.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/314/1*Hoh9tgjtRu56x87eprypfw.jpeg"/><figcaption>Pendulum states analougous to time crystal dynamic states</figcaption></figure> <p>A time crystal built inside a quantum computer had already indicated the true power of computation, a quantum computer has over a classical computer, as well as have cleared the direction of research on time crystals for its future applications of its initial state memory ability which might be useful as a quantum memory or quantum information processing for a quantum computer. Ever since this experiment, the research is extensively going on to combine multiple time crystals or creating one single huge time crystal to observe the limits and potential they carry for future applications. Recently theorist at university of Melbourne built a time crystal made of 57 qubits inside IBM’s quantum computer which is by far the biggest time crystal created, though it lasted for only 50 short cycles.</p> <p>Whereas an attempt made by a team in Aalto university, demonstrated interaction between two time crystals, each made up of trillions of magnons, which is collective excitation of electron’s spin, acting as an energy wave. These time crystals were made in an environment of Helium-3 isotope cooled closed to absolute zero, such that it became a B-phase superfluid. With this medium, time crystals were frozen to the point when all the atoms stop moving, reaching their lowest energy state, overlapping, and producing one high density cloud of atoms as a matter wave. This led the time crystals to touch each other allowing to exchange their magnons resulting into one single system of two dynamic states, thus acting as a single time crystal. Though this phenomenon was observed for quite a time, to maintain and control this specific environment for long enough is rather the most challenging part where, researchers are further looking into further developments.</p> <p>In future, what if we can make time crystals of macroscopic scale and can be used as an ordinary matter always getting restored to its previous state, whenever triggered. But as of now its limits seems to be within quantum realm.</p> <h4>References</h4> <ul><li><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/first-time-crystal-built-using-googles-quantum-computer-20210730/">Eternal Change for No Energy: A Time Crystal Finally Made Real | Quanta Magazine</a></li><li><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/physicists-produce-biggest-time-crystal-yet">Physicists produce biggest time crystal yet</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-have-built-a-two-body-system-using-time-crystals-for-the-first-time">Two Time Crystals Have Been Successfully Linked Together For The First Time</a></li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13232">Discrete Time Crystals</a></li></ul> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5706221e5ab4" width="1" height="1" alt=""/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
