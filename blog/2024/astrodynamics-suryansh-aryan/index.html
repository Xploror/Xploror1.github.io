            GRA Space@VT | Astrodynamics &amp; GNC researcher
        Last week, I had a fantastic time at the 2024 American Astronautical Society (AAS) Astrodynamics Specialist Conference in Broomfield, Colorado! Connecting with like-minded individuals and delving into the latest #Astrodynamics research was truly inspiring.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>During the event, I had the privilege of presenting my research work on “Four Body Invariant Structures And Chaos Analysis For Jovian Multi-Moon Ballistic Transfers,” alongside my advisor Dr. Riley Fitzgerald. I immensely look forward to further discussions on orbital stability and perturbation theory with the community soon. Check out my paper here for more details: https://lnkd.in/dRKJBdpgConsulting A great read, insightful and brilliantly articulated. Congratulations Suryansh!!

In this episode, we explore the phenomenon of Orbital Decay—a critical factor in the life of a spacecraft.</p> <p>𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐘𝐨𝐮’𝐥𝐥 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧:</p> <p>𝐎𝐫𝐛𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐲: Understand how and why the distance between a spacecraft and the body it orbits decreases over time.</p> <p>𝐂𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐲: Learn about the primary contributors to orbital decay.</p> <p>𝐋𝐨𝐰-𝐄𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐡 𝐎𝐫𝐛𝐢𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐲: Discover why spacecraft in low-earth orbit are particularly susceptible to orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. Watch as we model orbital decay in FreeFlyer and observe how the perigee and apogee values of a spacecraft decrease over time due to these forces.</p> <p>This video is perfect for those looking to deepen their understanding of the forces that affect spacecraft orbits over time.</p> <p>Watch now and stay tuned for more insights - https://lnkd.in/eeBqq8YR</p> <p>!#OrbitalMechanics #Astrodynamics #AerospaceEngineering #SpaceScience #STEMEducation #freeflyer #OrbitalDecay #Spacecraft #YoungEngineers #UniversityStudents #EngineeringEducation #AstrodynamicsExplained #SpaceExploration #FlightDynamics #SpacecraftDesign To view or add a comment, sign in</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>            1,701 followers

Spaceflight and terrestrial spaceflight analogs have the potential to alter immune phenotypes. 
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Macrophages, essential immune cells bridging the innate and adaptive immune systems, play CRITICAL roles in immunoregulatory processes of homeostasis. These cells are key in initiating immunity, defending against injury and infection, and are involved in immune resolution and wound healing.</p> <p>Diverse populations of macrophage-type cells reside in various tissues, causing tissue-specific effects through interactions with other physiological systems, including the nervous and endocrine systems.</p> <p>Understanding macrophage responses to the unique environment of #space is crucial for developing appropriate countermeasures to safeguard crew members 🧑🚀 on future missions in low Earth 🌍 orbit and even beyond.

        During spaceflight, the central nervous system (CNS) is exposed to a complex array of environmental stressors. However, the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the CNS and the resulting impact to crew health and operational performance remain largely unknown. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding spaceflight-associated changes to the brain as measured by magnetic resonance imaging, particularly as they relate to mission duration. Numerous studies have reported macrostructural changes to the brain after spaceflight, including alterations in brain position, tissue volumes and cerebrospinal fluid distribution and dynamics. Changes in brain tissue microstructure and connectivity were also described, involving regions related to vestibular, cerebellar, visual, motor, somatosensory and cognitive function.

        Sometimes you get these surreal moments in science where the reality of your work hits you - and this is it! Incredible to have an on-orbit shout out for our pupillometry payload from the Polaris Dawn crew (and great to hear they've been collecting data daily, ha).
